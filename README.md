# codegenerator

Script I created because I accidentally scratched a gift card too hard, leaving half of the characters barely legible.

Input the total length of your code, input your best guesses for each character, and the script will recursively generate possiblilities for your code, which will be output in a txt file and also logged to the terminal.
